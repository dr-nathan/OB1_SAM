TODO:
    
- Make priming possible: presentation of 2 subsequent words -> dive into simulte_experiments

- Implement SUBTLEX_UK DONE

- investigate how freq and pred files are created exactly. DONE
    
- Create_freq_pred: merge DE FR and EN.


Prime aanpak:

- run ncycles van prime, store activations, run ncycles of target

-saccade blindness after prime? is there a saccade at all?

- after change prime-target, should attention and visual focus be changed?

_ensure prime and target are at same location?

WHEN MERGING main and main_exp, figure out a way to make parameters and parameters_exp be chosen appropriately. If paramters get merge, maybe the problem becomes nonexistent.

MERGE parameters:
    IDEA: make pickles for every task. then import pickle on every run. 
    
IF not needed to run in parallel:
chose task (maybe pop up window?), then import parameters based on task: if is_experiment, import parameters-exp and make all called scripts import the right script.
or even concatenate parameters in one file? and clear overlap? which means you have to reset paraneters at every iteration. And parameters for experiment and reading are probably quite different.

If yes, separate parameters by renaming everything with pm_embeddedwords, and then simply call appropirate thing.
